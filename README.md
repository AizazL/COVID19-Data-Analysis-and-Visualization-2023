Dataset Provided by https://ourworldindata.org/

Dataset is of COVID-19 statistics in early 2023 from the COVID-19 database of OurWorldinData.org. 
This dataset is attached to this project as an excel sheet.

CovidDatabaseSQLQueries.sql is a file with all the queries made regarding this dataset.
These queries were used to interpolate this data and determine some unprovided statistics in the dataset such as death percentage of COVID-19 by country, as well as group data by Continent / Country to view the stats from a different perspective. 

Some of these queries have been used to create tables for visualization in Tableau.

Future Plans:
   - Update database automatically every x months.
   - Add more queries looking at Hospitilization/ICU patients vs resources.
